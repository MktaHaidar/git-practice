Gazing far into the unknown
Young eyes glimmering in wonder and awe
How can one resist something so pure and strong

Eternal fire
Rebirth and triumph, whoa-oh

Search goes on for this restless soul
Trying to find a peace of mind in the storm
Lost on earth
As if spellbound by some unseen force

Eternal fire
Rebirth and triumph, whoa-oh

Touch the flame and learn
