In total absence of light
We meet again
Equal in strength
My nemesis, my only friend

Abysmal oceans roar
With immortal hate
Imbued with blistering rage
You will ride the wave

Fight until you die by the blade
Of the one you hate
End of reason
End of the game
Die by the blade
Of the one you love to hate
With all your heart, ooh
